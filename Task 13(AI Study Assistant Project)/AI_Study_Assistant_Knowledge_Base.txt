1. What is Artificial Intelligence?
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the branch of computer science that aims to create machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.

2. Types of AI:
- Narrow AI: AI systems that are trained to perform a single task (e.g., voice assistants).
- General AI: A type of AI that can perform any intellectual task a human can do.
- Super AI: Hypothetical AI that surpasses human intelligence in all aspects.

3. Applications of AI:
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Image Recognition
- Autonomous Vehicles
- Robotics
- Expert Systems

4. What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

5. Types of Machine Learning:
- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning

6. What is Deep Learning?
Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning that uses neural networks with many layers to analyze various factors of data.

7. What is NLP?
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of AI that gives machines the ability to read, understand, and derive meaning from human languages.

8. Frequently Asked Questions:

Q: How is AI used in everyday life?
A: Through smartphones, recommendation systems, smart home devices, etc.

Q: What is the Turing Test?
A: A test to determine if a machine's behavior is indistinguishable from a human.

Q: What are neural networks?
A: A set of algorithms modeled loosely after the human brain, designed to recognize patterns.

Q: Difference between AI and ML?
A: AI is the broader concept of machines being able to carry out tasks smartly. ML is a subset of AI focused on learning from data.
